# descenders-tree_generation
tree generation for unity 2017

This works by using the center of your terrain and expanding outwards
You can change the tint of the leaves if your prefabs allow hue changes
Creates all your trees/bushes into a parent object so you can easily remove if needed
Can also have trees be different scales

1. place RandomForestMultiEditor.cs into Assets/Editor
2. goto Tools - Create Random Forest Multi
3. drag your terrain into the terrain spot
4. drag your tree prefabs into prefab spot
5. customize settings per tree/bush most trees are not above a 40 degree slope
   and most bushes arent above a 60 degree slope in the real world
6. Hit generate and enjoy!
